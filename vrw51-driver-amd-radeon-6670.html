I bought the card from Newegg last month and the driver kept crashing and there would be random bluescreens.

One day I loaded up my PC (This was before I built my current one) it was working fine like always until it blue screened I thought nothing of it since it had never happened before and didn’t fire a while after that.

Just want to get it running first. I have installed linux for the first time. Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS 64bit. Seems that AMD doesn't provide driver updates for HD6670 anymore for Ubuntu 16.04 onwards in form of proprietary drivers. So I ended up installing Oibaf drivers. Here is the output of glxinfo. Hey! So I bought an AMD RX 480 back in January. Everything worked fine for the first two weeks, then i started getting issues like different flashing colours while gaming, DX crashes, GPU driver crashes. Tried to fix it by underclocking and undervolting GPU and after that got errors that meant CPU wasn't getting any power or RAM didnt get power. PC works fine with Intel HD and also with Radeon HD 6670. Current specs: CPU: i7 3770K It's worth noting that I already have a decent budget gaming rig. That being said, I wanted to get dabbling in Linux and Linux Gaming, so I built a rig out of spare parts I had lying around.

This is kind of a crippling bug and one that really needs. I have an Optiplex 990 with stock MOBO, i7 2600 and 8GB RAM. I recently upgraded from a Radeon 6670 to a GTX 1050ti.
